## Description

Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. I was required to use the dataset provided to build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.
I used decision trees and SVM to build several models that predict whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that they have hypothyroid, then using their accuracy levels and RMSE values then picked the AdaBoost as the most accurate model at predicting.
